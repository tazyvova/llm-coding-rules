# Agent Rules

See [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md) for coding standards.

## Directory Restrictions

- Stay within project folder only
- Access to other directories only after explicit agreement

## Task Management

- Long tasks → create `.tasks/TODO.md` (gitignored), update after each step
- Save plans to `.tasks/plans/` (gitignored)
- Follow TDD workflow if `TDD.md` exists in project root

## Debugging

- Check `git log` for recent changes before investigating issues

## Self-Improvement

- If an instruction is given twice → suggest adding it to rule files
